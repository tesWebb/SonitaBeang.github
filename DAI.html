Data science combines statistical tools, methods, and technology to generate meaning from data. Artificial Intelligence
takes this one step further and uses the data to solve cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence,
such as learning, pattern recognition, and human-like expression.
Program Learning Outcomes
Main goals of the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence department are to:
</br>1-Apply data science theory and software development fundamentals to produce AIbased solutions
</br>2-Determine an algorithm’s efficiency, computability and resource usage.
</br>3-Utilize the latest tools and technologies in data science and AI to develop creative and innovative solutions.
</br>4-Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline.
</br>5-Conduct scientific research and practical projects that produce significant AI software solutions.
